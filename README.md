# deepspeech-arabic

This is a preliminary experiment to build an end-to-end Arabic ASR using DeepSpeech engine.

I used Common Voice Corpus 7.0 for training (https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets). In this version, Arabic voices are 1,052 and the total length is 137 hours.

You can download the model from here:
